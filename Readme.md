# Automata Equivalence

This is a console program that receives the matrix representations of two DFA and prints if they are equivalent or not.

## How to run

This program was created with C# and Core .NET so you only need to compile it and run it from console. I personally use Visual Studio and its Build/Publish options.

## Examples

The folder AutomataEquivalence/Examples contains examples of matrix. If you run the program in all of those examples you can get their value of equivalence or not:
